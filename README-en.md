# mObywatel Mobile
On December 29, 2025, the publication of mObywatel's source code was announced.

What exactly did we get? In accordance with the legal obligation arising from the Act of May 26, 2023 on the mObywatel application (Journal of Laws of 2023, item 1234):

- [The code page](https://www.mobywatel.gov.pl/kod-zrodlowy-mobywatel-mobilny), which requires logging in with mObywatel/a [trusted profile](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profil_zaufany)/a Polish bank account/eID
- A gallery for browsing some of the assets and the code itself, licensed under the ([MIT license](LICENSE.md)), limited to code concerning the design system of the mObywatel application, i.e. UI components, colours, styles, icons
- The ability to right-click is blocked, you need to use an add-on such as [Allow Right Click](https://webextension.org/listing/allow-right-click.html)

This means that things like these were not published:
- business logic, in any scope
- API, communication with other components
- authentication module
- documentation

Imagine that mObywatel is a large building complex. We were supposed to learn the secrets of this complex, and instead, we have found out what kind of paint was used to paint the facade of the building...

### Statement from the COI CEO regarding the MIT license
"(...) The publication of the code is based on the opinions of CSIRTs, hence this solution and the scope of the code (perhaps not so extensive). When publishing code, we should rather impose an open-source license, and MIT was chosen as the most appropriate one. Ukraine also published under a [free software] license, only they have chosen EUPL 1.2."
